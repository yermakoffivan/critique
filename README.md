## Installation

critique requires [Bun](https://bun.sh). It does not run under Node.js.

```bash
# Run directly without installing
bunx critique

# Or install globally
bun install -g critique
```

## Quick Start

Open the current working tree diff in the terminal:

```bash
critique
```

Upload the same diff and get a shareable URL:

```bash
critique --web "Current working tree"
```

Review staged changes:

```bash
critique --staged
critique --staged --web "Staged changes"
```

## Core Diff Commands

critique follows the same mental model as `git diff`.

```bash
# View unstaged changes, including untracked files
critique

# View staged changes
critique --staged

# View changes since a ref
critique HEAD~1
critique main

# View one commit only
critique --commit HEAD~1
critique --commit abc1234

# Compare two refs, PR style
critique main HEAD
critique main feature-branch

# Watch the working tree and refresh on changes
critique --watch

# Add experimental call-stack changes to the file tree
critique --calldiff

# Filter files by glob pattern
critique --filter "src/**/*.ts"
critique --filter "src/**/*.ts" --filter "lib/**/*.js"
```

## Which Commits a Diff Contains

Whenever a diff spans commits, critique lists them before the diff or the URL.

```
3 commits, 22 files, +1573 -311

  2a09302  Correct the identity docs, and mark the release minor
  1fb8af7  Give every element a stable GPUI identity
  7998490  Launch a window without stealing focus
  base: f948f50  Reclaim the style table when the tree shrinks

  + uncommitted working tree changes
```

This matters because a **rebased branch can carry commits replayed from another
branch**. The merge base is then too far back, and a shared link silently includes
work you did not write. If a listed commit is not yours, pass the first commit of
**your own work** as the base:

```bash
# Wrong: the merge base pulls in a commit a rebase replayed onto the branch
critique f948f50 --web "Element identity"

# Right: start from your own first commit
critique 7998490 --web "Element identity"
```

Long ranges are truncated, but the **oldest commits are always kept**, because a rebase
replays a foreign commit right above the base. Silence the list in scripts with
`--no-commit-list`. With `--json` it goes to stderr and the commits are added to the
JSON payload instead.

### Diverged Branches

`critique A..B` and `critique <ref>` compare two trees directly. On **diverged**
branches such a diff also **undoes** every commit that exists only on the base side.
Those commits are part of the diff, so critique lists them too:

```
1 commit added, 1 commit reversed, 2 files, +1 -1

  added by right:
    a279fbe  Only on right

  reversed from left:
    d395611  Only on left

  ! left and right have diverged, so this diff also undoes the commits above.
```

`critique A...B` and `critique A B` start at the **merge base** instead, so they never
reverse anything, and the `base:` line names the merge base rather than the ref.

Plain unstaged and `--staged` diffs contain no commits, so nothing is printed.

## Call-stack Diffs

`--calldiff` uses [calldiff](https://github.com/tanishqkancharla/calldiff) to show how function calls changed. Each changed call tree appears below its source file in the top file tree.

```bash
# Working tree call changes
critique --calldiff

# Changes since a ref
critique main --calldiff

# PR-style comparison and web preview
critique main HEAD --calldiff --web "Call flow changes"

# One commit
critique --commit HEAD --calldiff
```

The feature is experimental. calldiff uses Tree-sitter and can install a language grammar through npm on first use. `--staged`, `--stdin`, and `--watch` are not supported with `--calldiff`.

Set `CRITIQUE_CALLDIFF=1` to enable call-stack diffs by default:

```bash
export CRITIQUE_CALLDIFF=1
critique
```

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Scroll up and down |
| `p` | Open file selector dropdown |
| `t` | Open theme picker |
| `Option` held | Fast scroll at 10x speed |
| `g` `g` / `G` | Jump to top / bottom |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` | Half page down / up |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit / close overlay |

## Web Previews

`--web` renders the diff with the same terminal renderer, uploads it to [critique.work](https://critique.work), and prints a shareable URL.

```bash
# Working tree changes
critique --web "Fix auth retry"

# Staged changes
critique --staged --web "Release notes"

# Changes since a ref
critique main --web "Branch changes"

# One commit
critique --commit HEAD --web "Latest commit"

# PR-style branch diff
critique main HEAD --web "Current branch"

# JSON output for scripts
critique --web "Deploy changes" --json
```

Generated URLs look like `critique.work/v/<id>`.

### How Web Uploads Work

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ git diff                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ opentui test renderer               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HTML variants and raw patch         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ critique.work upload                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ shareable URL, optional .patch      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The CLI does **not** generate a local HTML file. It uploads to `critique.work`. Local HTML export is tracked separately in [issue #42](https://github.com/remorses/critique/issues/42).

Uploaded diffs expire after 7 days unless you use a license key. Identical diffs reuse the same content hash URL.

## Raw Patch Access

Every `--web` upload also stores the raw unified diff. Append `.patch` to any critique URL to fetch it.

```bash
CRITIQUE_URL='https://critique.work/v/<id>'

# View the patch in your terminal
curl "$CRITIQUE_URL.patch"

# Apply the patch directly to your repo
curl -s "$CRITIQUE_URL.patch" | git apply

# Reverse the patch
curl -s "$CRITIQUE_URL.patch" | git apply --reverse
```

## Git Difftool Integration

Configure critique as your git difftool:

```bash
git config --global diff.tool critique
git config --global difftool.critique.cmd 'critique difftool "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
```

Then run:

```bash
git difftool HEAD~1
```

## Lazygit Integration

Use critique as a custom pager in [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit):

```yaml
# ~/.config/lazygit/config.yml
git:
  pagers:
    - pager: critique --stdin
```

For details, see [lazygit's Custom Pagers documentation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Custom_Pagers.md).

## Pick Files from Another Branch

`critique pick` lets you apply selected files from another branch to the current checkout.

```bash
critique pick feature-branch
```

Selected files are applied as patches. Deselected files are restored.

## Selective Hunk Staging

`critique hunks` gives scripts and agents a stable alternative to `git add -p`.

```bash
# List unstaged hunks with stable IDs
critique hunks list

# List staged hunks
critique hunks list --staged

# Filter by file pattern
critique hunks list --filter "src/**/*.ts"

# Stage one hunk by ID
critique hunks add 'src/main.ts:@-10,6+10,7'

# Stage multiple hunks
critique hunks add 'src/main.ts:@-10,6+10,7' 'src/utils.ts:@-5,3+5,4'
```

Hunk IDs use this format:

```text
file:@-oldStart,oldLines+newStart,newLines
```

The ID comes from the unified diff `@@` header, so it stays stable across runs.

## E-Ink Reading

Generate PDFs from diffs to read on Kindle or Boox e-readers.

```bash
critique --pdf
critique main --pdf --open
```

The PDF preserves syntax highlighting and diff formatting. Email it to your Kindle, drop it in BooxDrop, or save it to a synced Google Drive folder. See [docs/e-reader-guide.md](docs/e-reader-guide.md) for setup details.

## Agent Skill

This package ships a skill file that teaches AI coding agents how to use critique for diff URLs, PDFs, images, and selective hunk staging.

```bash
npx -y skills add remorses/critique
```

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting:** powered by [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) via [opentui](https://github.com/sst/opentui)
- **Split view:** side-by-side comparison for wide terminals, unified view on narrow terminals
- **Word-level diff:** highlights exact word changes inside modified lines
- **File navigation:** quick file switcher with fuzzy search
- **Click to open:** click line numbers to open in your editor with `REACT_EDITOR`
- **Watch mode:** refreshes as you edit files
- **Web previews:** hosted shareable URLs on [critique.work](https://critique.work)
- **Raw patches:** every web preview has a `.patch` endpoint
- **PDF output:** optimized for code review away from the terminal

## Supported Languages

TypeScript, JavaScript, TSX, JSX, JSON, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Scala, Haskell, Julia, OCaml, Clojure, Swift, Nix, YAML, and Bash.

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REACT_EDITOR` | Editor command for click-to-open | `zed` |

## Ignored Files

Lock files are automatically hidden from diffs:

- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `bun.lockb`
- `bun.lock`
- `Cargo.lock`
- `poetry.lock`
- `Gemfile.lock`
- `composer.lock`

Files with more than 6000 lines of diff are also hidden for performance.
